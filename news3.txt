Brazil legend Pele says he is "recovering very well" after briefly being readmitted to intensive care following a recent operation.

The 80-year-old had surgery to remove a tumour from his colon this month and was initially released from intensive care on Wednesday.

Sao Paulo's Albert Einstein Hospital said he was readmitted "as a preventative measure".

"My friends, I am still recovering very well," Pele wrote on Instagram.

"Today I received visits from family members and I continue to smile every day. Thank you for all the love I get from you."
